        "## Hybrid method: Recursive feature elimination\n",
        "\n",
        "This method consists of the following steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Rank the features according to their importance derived from a machine learning algorithm: it can be tree importance, or LASSO / Ridge, or the linear / logistic regression coefficients.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Remove one feature -the least important- and build a machine learning algorithm utilising the remaining features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Calculate a performance metric of your choice: roc-auc, mse, rmse, accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) If the metric decreases by more of an arbitrarily set threshold, then that feature is important and should be kept. Otherwise, we can remove that feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Repeat steps 2-4 until all features have been removed (and therefore evaluated) and the drop in performance assessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "I call this a hybrid method because:\n",
        "\n",
        "- it combines the importance derived from the machine learning algorithm like embedded methods,\n",
        "- and it removes as well one feature at a time, and calculates a new metric based on the new subset of features and the machine learning algorithm of choice, like wrapper methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between this method and the step backwards feature selection we learned in previous lectures lies in that it does not remove all features first in order to determine which one to remove. It removes the least important one, based on the machine learning model derived important. And then, it makes an assessment as to whether that feature should be removed or not. So it removes each feature only once during selection, whereas step backward feature selection removes all the features at each step of selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is therefore faster than wrapper methods and generally better than embedded methods. In practice it works extremely well. It does also account for correlations (depending on how stringent you set the arbitrary performance drop threshold). On the downside, the drop in performance assessed to decide whether the feature should be kept or removed, is set arbitrarily. The smaller the drop the more features will be selected, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will demonstrate how to select features using this method on a regression and classification problem. For classification I will use the Paribas claims dataset from Kaggle. For regression, the House Price dataset from Kaggle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note** For the demonstration, I will use XGBoost, but this method is useful for any machine learning algorithm. In fact, the importance of the features are determined specifically for the algorithm used. Therefore, different algorithms may return different subsets of important features.\n"
